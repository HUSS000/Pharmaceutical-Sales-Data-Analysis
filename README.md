# Pharmaceutical-Sales-Data-Analysis
An interactive Pharmaceutical Sales Dashboard built in Power BI using Excel as raw data and a Galaxy Schema model for ETL. It tracks sales vs. targets, rep and product performance, and highlights insights through KPIs and RCA for smarter business decisions.

This project was an incredible journey, and I‚Äôm proud to say it was recognized for its strong analytical insights and visualization quality!

üìå The challenge:
 üëâ Analyze the pharmaceutical sales performance across multiple clusters, representatives, and product categories to uncover:
 Did the sales teams meet their targets, and which areas drove (or limited) performance? etc. 

üßæ Using Excel as the raw data source and Power BI for the complete ETL process, I built a structured data model using a Galaxy Schema to connect FactTables (sales & targets) with DimTables (representatives, clusters, and products) 1:* relationship. The result was a fully interactive dashboard that tells the complete sales story ‚Äî from performance tracking to root cause analysis (RCA).

üìä Top Insights:
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Achievement Highlight: The sales target was achieved only once, at 121.16% of the target (+604K), showing strong recovery compared to previous periods.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Growth Trend: Sales showed a 29.6% YoY increase, indicating continuous progress and improved efficiency across product lines.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Top Performer: The Glucophage family dominated sales with 54.29% of total revenue, while Glucovance had the lowest share (5.86%) ‚Äî a key opportunity for improvement.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Price Dynamics: Concor maintained the highest selling price per unit, reflecting its strong market positioning while Glucophage Family scores the highest overall sales.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster & Accounts Insight: The Shared cluster recorded the highest total sales, while Kuwait Oil Co. emerged as the top-performing account in the Semi cluster.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Rep Performance: Most sales representatives achieved their targets, showing clear progress in sales distribution and team performance.
