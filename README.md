# Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis
An interactive Pharmaceutical Sales Dashboard built in Power BI using Excel as raw data and a Galaxy Schema model for ETL. It tracks sales vs. targets, rep and product performance, and highlights insights through KPIs and RCA for smarter business decisions.

This project was an incredible journey, and I‚Äôm proud to say it was recognized for its strong analytical insights and visualization quality!

üìå The challenge:

 üëâ Analyze the pharmaceutical sales performance across multiple clusters, representatives, and product categories to uncover:
 Did the sales teams meet their targets, and which areas drove (or limited) performance? etc.

üìà Data Modeling:

Using Excel as the raw data source and Power BI for the complete ETL process, I built a structured data model using a Galaxy Schema to connect FactTables (sales & targets) with DimTables (representatives, clusters, and products) 1:* relationship. The result was a fully interactive dashboard that tells the complete sales story ‚Äî from performance tracking to root cause analysis (RCA).
